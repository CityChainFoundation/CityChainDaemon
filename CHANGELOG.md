### Breaking Change

* Add ISetupSequentialResult<TResult>.Returns method overload that support delegate for deferred results (@snrnats, #594)
This change requires the API consumer to specify the type in ISetupSequentialResult<TResult>.Returns when returning null. Otherwise, it is ambiguous whether the type returned is a Type or a Func<Type>.
https://github.com/moq/moq4/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

* Updated System.Reactive to 4.0.0

* Updated Newtonsoft.Json 10.0.3 -> 11.0.2

* Updated to dotnet 2.1

* updated dotnet version for Travis build

* Added version to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App
