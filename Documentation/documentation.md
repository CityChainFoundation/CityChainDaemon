# Documentation

The documentation is written using Markdown and is generated using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/).

Documentation that is generated and published, is located under the /doc folder in the repo, and it will
read the /src folder to generate API documentation.

To serve the documentation locally, install and run docfx:

```
docfx doc\docfx.json --serve
```
